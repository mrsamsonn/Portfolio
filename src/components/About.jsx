        I am a current student at California State University, East Bay with 
        a strong foundation in C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, React, Vite, and Bash shell, 
        as well as Beaglebone, Arduino, and Rasberry Pi builds, I am eager to bring my skills
        and passion to the software industry and hardware industry.
        <br/>
        I have gained practical experience through various projects, 
        including Reddit sentiment analysis for cryptocurrency and stock price action, 
        hardware data retrieval, API integration using bash scripting, and other projects. 
        These projects have allowed me to apply my knowledge of programming and scripting to
         real-world scenarios and to develop my problem-solving skills.
         <br/>
        I am a fast learner, highly motivated, and passionate about technology. 
        I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow and expand my skills. 
        I am confident that I can make a positive contribution to your team and help drive your
         company's success.
